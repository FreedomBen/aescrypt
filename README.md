========

This repository houses the source code for AES Crypt, with some slight modifications.  This is not an official AES Crypt repository.  Please visit http://www.aescrypt.com/ for more information.  

This version will compile to a static binary.  To succeed, Fedora needs these packages installed:

1. glibc
1. glibc-devel
1. glibc-static
